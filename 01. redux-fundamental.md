redux : statement management tool 

redux's 5 methods :
    1. createStore : has 4 methods 
    2. bindActionCreators : kinds of uses compose, combine multi fns and return a fn out of it
    3. combineReducers 
    4. compose : a function thats similar to flow, take a set of fns and create a fn, then pass value through each of them
    5. applyMiiddleware
    **useSelector useDispatch is not part of redux, its part of react-redux**


# compose: 

    const a = strinig => string.toUpperCase()
    const b = strinig => string.repeat(2)
    const c = strinig => string.bold()

    const combine = compose (a, b, c)

# createStore: 
    const store = createStore(**reducer** , initalState)
                              **reducer** : pure function => initalState + action ==> new state
                                                                           **action** : an object that must have a type

    example: 
        const initalState = {value: 0}
        const incrementAction = { type: "INCREMENT", playload: 5 } // MUST have type for an action. 

        const reducer = (state = initalSate , action) => {
            if(action.type === "INCREMENT") {
                return { value : state.value + 1 }
            }
            return state
        }

    **store's properties**: 
        dispatch : sends action to reducer to change state 
        subscribe : calls fn when state changes 
        getstate : get the state
        replaceReducer : use for code splitting

## Action Creator: a simple function that creates action type 
    const increment = () => ({ type:"INCREMENT" })

## setting initalSate
    1. pass as 2nd arg in createStore 
    2. set default value of state param in reducer function 

## subscribe 
    const subscriber = () => { console.log("subscribe", store.getState()) }
    store.subscibe(subscriber)  

    store.dispath(increment())      // calls action --> changes state --> subscribe gets called
    store.dispath(increment())      // calls action --> changes state --> subscribe gets called


# bindActionCreators : binds actions to 

    const actions = bindActionCreators ({ increment }, store.dispatch)
                                        **action creators**, **bind it to : dispatch**
    actions.increment() 

# combine reducer
    **
        deals with nested data structure,
        split data into samll trunks,
        each reducer deals with a trunk of data 
        combine reducer then assign each reudcer to deal with that part of the data trunk 
    ** 


    const reducerA = (stateA = initalState.stateA, action) => {
        if(action.type === "x") return [...stateA, action.payload]
        return stateA
    }

     const reducerB = (stateB = initalState.stateB, action) => {
        if(action.type === "y") return [...stateB, action.payload]
        return stateB
    }

    const reducer = combineReducer({ stateA: reducerA, stateB: reducerB } )

    const store = createStore(reducer, initalState)

    
 
# Enhaner & Middleware

## Enhaner concept
        add addtional function to redux store. 
        the Enchaner gets an instance of createStore, allows us perform the fn and pass the args to it.
        wrap the renders in enhancer, inside the enhaner, do the orginal reducer job.


## Enhaner syntax (practise)
        const reducer = state => state 
        
        const monitorEnhancer = (createStore) => (reducer, initalState,enhancer ) => {
            const monitorReducer = (state, action) => {
                const start = performance.now()
                const newState = reducer(state, action)
                const end = performance.now()
                return newState
            }
            return createStore(monitorReducer, initalState, enhancer)

        }

        const store = createStore(reducer, monitorEnhancer) 

        store.dispatch ({type: "x"})

## Middleware concept 
    an abstraction of enhancer, does one thing: mangage action as they flow through redecer 

## Middleware syntax (practise)

    const logMiddleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
        console.log('old state', state.getState(), action)
        next(action)
         console.log('new state', state.getState(), action)
    }

    const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiiddleware(logMiddleware))

    store.dispatch({type: 'x'})



# how to review this chapter 

1.  name redux's fundamental properties, what is the concept of each of the properties 

2.  write a simple example of compose 

3.  how to create a store ? 
    what do we need in order to create a store ? 
    when store is create, what properites does the store have? name them.
    write the syntax. 

4.  how to bindActions ? 
    what do we need to bindActions 
    where does the actions are binded to? 
    how to use the actions after binding? 
    write the syntax 

5.  when to combineReducer ? 
    how does each "tiny" reducer work with the data
    how to create a combinedReducer
    write an example, with give data structure.  // todo 

6.  what is enhaner, what does it do? 
    write an example enhaner.

7.  what is a middleware in redux, what does it do? 
    write an example of middleware.

8. what is a reducer 
    reducer is a function that takes one piece of data and an action to perform on that data, then return the new data. 

9. what is an action in redux
