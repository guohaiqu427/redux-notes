redux: 

    actions.js
        export const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT"
        export const increment = (value) => ({type: INCREMENT, payload: value})
    
    reducer.js
        import  { INCREMENT } from "./actions"

        export const initialState = { count: 0 }

        export const reducer = (state = initialState , action)  => {

            if(action.type === INCREMENT) return count: state + payload

            return state
        }

    store.js 
        import {createStore} from "redux"
        import {a} from "./reducer"

        export const store = createStore(reducer)

    index.js 
        import { Provider } from "react-redux"
        import { store } from "./store"

        <Provider store = {store} ></Provider> 

Hooks API

    1--> use hooks directly

        import {useSelector} from "react-redux"
        const count = useSelector (state => state.count)

        import {useDispatch} from "react-redux" 
        const dispatch = useDispatch()

        onClick = { () => { dispatch(increment(5)) } }
    
    2--> bind actions 
        import {bindActionCreator} from "redux"

        const actions = bindActionCreators ({increment}, dispatch)

        onClick = { () => { actions.increment(5) }

    3--> custom hooks

    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=++++++++++++
    encaplsulate actions: 
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=++++++++++++

    use-actions.js : encaplsulate all actions in a custom hook 

        import {useDispatch} from ...
        import {bindActionCreators} from ...

        export const useActions = (actions) => {
            const dispatch = useDispatch()
            return bindActionCreators (actions, dispatch)
        }

    component.jsx 
        import {useActions} from ... 
        import {action1, action2, action3} from ...

        const actions = useActions({action1, action2, action3})
        onClick = { () => { actions.action1(5) }



    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=++++++++++++
    encaplsulate data and actions: 
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=++++++++++++

        use-counter.js : encaplsulate all state and actions a component need into a custom hook 
            import {useSelector} from ...
            import {useAction} from "./use-action.js"
            import {action1, action2....} from "./actions"

            export const useCounter = () => {
                const count = useSelector (state=> state.count)
                const actions = useActions({action1, action2, action3})

                return {count, ...actions}
            }

        component.jsx 
            import {useCounter} from ...

            const {count, action1 ...} = useCounter()

            onClick = { () => { action1(5) }

            {count}


Connect API: it all happens in container.js not reducer.js or action.js 

    what is a presentational component?
        it is a component that does not deal with data.

    how does connection api work in redux? 
        wrap presentational component in container and let the continaer deals with data:
            1. take data the component needs from the store.
            2. use a function called mapStateToProps to return the data  it took from store, edit it and give it to presentational
            3. takes the dispatch object from the store.
            4. return a object that contains the dispatch action the component needs
            5. replace the use of presentational component with container in jsx. 
    
    how to use the connection API?
        connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps )(presentational component)

    what is mapStateToProps?
        it is esstenically a function, 
        that takes in the state, 
        and return the value the component needs. 

    what is mapDispatchToProps? 
        it's a function that takes the dispatch object (also the ownProps of the component). edit it and return to the component 
        return a object that has a key that matches the component's props. and the value is dispatch action
        {propName: (params)=> dispatch(action(params)) }



    syntax:     
        ... some imports

        const mapStateToProps = state => {  
            const value = {some logic to mutate the state}
            return value
        }

        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => {
            return {
                remove: (payload) =>  dispatch(action(ownProps, payload))
            }
        }

       export const container =  connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps )(component)

       replace component with container 

       <contianer> </contianer> 


createSelector: 
    export const selectItem = state => state.item
    export const value = createSelector([selectItem], items => {items.reduce(...)=> { ...} })
                         createSelector( arg1, arg2 )
                                         arg1:  array of functions that take data from the store, as long as the returned value is no changed,
                                               the computation wont execute
                                         arg2: mutate logic if arg1's retrun data changes. 


Immer: treat immutatable object as mutatbale, under the hood, the library will figure out how to implement. 

if(action.type === "x") {
    produce(state, (draftState) => {
        const item = { .... }
        draftState.push(item)
    })
}

instead of  return [...state, item]

if(action.type === "x") {
    const item = { .... }
    return [...state, item]
}

Redux Dev tool: 
    in store.js.
    const enhancer = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__();
    export const store = createStore(reducer, enhancer)




# how to review this chapter 

    1. prepare a form, 

    2. implement redux in proper structure ( create store, actions, reducer, provider)

    3. use redux in proper structure with hooks API

    4. create a custom hook for actions 

    5. create a custom hook for the component that needs redux 

    6. what is connection api, advantages vs hooks api 

    7. what is the syntax of connection api 

    8. what does mapStateToProps do? what is the syntax 

    9. what does mapDispatchToProps do? what is the syntax 

    10. todo: params of the mapDispatchToProps (ownProps and  function params, what is the difference)

    11. what does createSelector do? 
        what is the benefit of using createSelector? 
        what is the syntax? 

    12. what is immer? 
        why is it useful? 
        what is the syntax?
